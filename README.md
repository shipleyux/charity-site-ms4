# Swansea Women's Aid Website

A full-stack charity website developed for Swansea Womenâ€™s Aid, built as part of the Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development (Unit 4). This platform provides support and information for women and children experiencing domestic abuse, allowing users to read the latest news, donate securely, and get in touch through a simple contact form.

The site is designed with accessibility, user experience, and scalability in mind. It includes a secure CMS for staff to manage blog posts and a donation system integrated with Stripe. The project demonstrates full CRUD functionality, user authentication, relational database use, and clean, maintainable code.
