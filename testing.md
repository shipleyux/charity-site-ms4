# Testing & Validation

### Overview

Testing was carried out throughout development to ensure functionality, usability, and responsiveness. Due to time constraints and project scope, manual testing was the primary method used.

### Manual Testing

Manual tests were performed on all key features using a range of browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (laptop, tablet, mobile). The following areas were tested:

| Feature                      | Test Performed                                                                 | Outcome        |

| Navigation bar              | Checked visibility, responsiveness, and active links                            | Pass ‚úÖ         |

| Contact form                | Tested required fields and success message upon submission                      | Pass ‚úÖ         |
| Stripe donation form        | Verified with test card, handled success/cancel flows                           | Pass ‚úÖ         |
| User authentication         | Tested login, logout, restricted page access for unauthenticated users          | Pass ‚úÖ         |
| 404 / 500 error pages       | Triggered intentionally to confirm custom error pages are displayed             | Pass ‚úÖ         |
| Footer login link           | Confirmed visibility and restricted access only for staff                       | Pass ‚úÖ         |

### Stripe Testing

Stripe‚Äôs test environment was used with the following test cards:

- **Successful payment**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

```bash
python manage.py test core
```

### üöÄ Heroku Deployment Debug Report

During deployment to Heroku, I encountered several issues that required troubleshooting and debugging:

#### ‚õî Deployment Failures
- **`ModuleNotFoundError: dj_database_url`** despite being in `requirements.txt`.
- Static files not displaying due to missing `collectstatic` command.
- App crashed on first load due to missing `SECRET_KEY` and incorrect `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

#### ‚úÖ Fixes Applied
- Reinstalled all dependencies and regenerated `requirements.txt` with `pip freeze`.
- Set environment variables (`SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DEBUG=False`) via Heroku dashboard.
- Ran `python manage.py collectstatic` and committed the static files.
- Updated `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include the live Heroku domain.

### üí≥ Stripe Integration Issues

#### Problem
- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'stripe'` after initial deploy.
- Stripe threw an `UndefinedValueError` due to a missing `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`.

#### Solution
- Installed Stripe with `pip install stripe`.
- Added `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` to the `.env` file and confirmed `python-decouple` was loading it.
- Restarted the server after updating the environment.
- Removed unused import (`donation_thank_you`) that referenced a non-existent view.

### üóìÔ∏è Debug Log: Missing Post Timestamp

#### Problem
- Blog post list displayed title and author, but **not** the date/time.

#### Root Cause
- Template was using `{{ post.timestamp }}`, but the model field was `created_on`.

#### Fix
- Updated template to `{{ post.created_on|date:"F j, Y, g:i a" }}` and the date appeared correctly.
